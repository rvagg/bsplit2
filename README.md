# bsplit2

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bsplit2.svg)](https://nodei.co/npm/bsplit2/)

A transform stream that splits incoming data into newline separated chunks.

Similar to [split2](https://github.com/mcollina/split2) but only operates on the binary data, doesn't do a string conversion, and _only_ looks for `\n` in the incoming stream. Use split2 if you want to break on `/\r?\n/` or if you're concerned that `\n` may not properly indicate newlines (e.g. unicode codepoints that include `\n` bytes).

Not similar and no relation to the "bsplit" package.

## API

```js
const bsplit = require('bsplit2')
const splittingStream = bsplit()
// ... pipe something through splittingStream ...
```

## Example

example.js:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const bsplit = require('bsplit2')

let i = 1
fs.createReadStream(__filename)
  .pipe(bsplit())
  .on('data', (line) => console.log(`${i++}: ${line.toString()}`))
```

When run, will output:

```
1: const fs = require('fs')
2: const bsplit = require('bsplit2')
3: 
4: let i = 1
5: fs.createReadStream(__filename)
6:   .pipe(bsplit())
7:   .on('data', (line) => console.log(`${i++}: ${line.toString()}`))
```

Or if you want to use a stream as an async iterator:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const bsplit = require('bsplit2')

async function run () {
  let i = 1
  const stream = fs.createReadStream(__filename).pipe(bsplit())

  for await (const line of stream) {
    console.log(`${i++}: ${line.toString()}`)
  }
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err.stack)
  process.exit(1)
})
```

When run, will output:

```
1: const fs = require('fs')
2: const bsplit = require('bsplit2')
3: 
4: async function run () {
5:   let i = 1
6:   const stream = fs.createReadStream(__filename).pipe(bsplit())
7: 
8:   for await (const line of stream) {
9: 	  console.log(`${i++}: ${line.toString()}`)
10:   }
11: }
12: 
13: run().catch((err) => {
14:   console.error(err.stack)
15:   process.exit(1)
16: })
```

bsplit2's readable streams are "[object mode](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode)" meaning that they apply different backpressure rules even though they are still dealing with binary data. This may be an important consideration depending on your use-case. This can be turned off by messing with `stream._readableState.objectMode` (not recommended) but the internal stream `read()` function will revert back to providing non-newline-delimited chunks because it pulls from a buffer of chunks. This impacts async iterators and some other stream modes but the `'data'` event won't be impacted although it will drop blank lines.
